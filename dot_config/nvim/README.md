# Neovim Config

## TODOs
[ ] - neo-tree is bugging
[ ] - explore built-in terminal to see if it can replace toggleterm
[ ] - source python venv when opening terminal, if not active
[ ] - setup debugger and understand its usage
[ ] - use vim.keymap.set to setup all keymaps
[ ] - setup git workflows and related plugins 
[ ] - performance feels slow sometimes, especially on large code files
